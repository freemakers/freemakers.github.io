### Welcome!

This site is dedicated to the makers at the Lawrence Center for Entrepeneurship. Inside, you'll find articles and other training materials to help you use our tools (including this website). You'll also find sections that serve as workspaces for individual projects our members are working on.


### We Know You Can't Always Be Here...

If you're like most of us, you can't spend all your time here at the makerspace. We know all about those times when you find inspiration for a project while you're driving to work. Instead of forgetting all those little insights, keep your project notes here! You can edit pages directly in GitHub, and see the changes reflected here immediately.

To get started, see the [Project Website](training/project-ghpages.html) article in the [Training](training/index.html) section of this site.
